Jimmy Carter, the 39th U.S. president, enters hospice care

Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States, 
was moved to hospice care on Saturday.

"After a series of short hospital stays, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter 
today decided to spend his remaining time at home with his family and receive 
hospice care instead of additional medical intervention," 
the Carter Center said in a statement on Saturday.

Carter, who turned 98 in October, served as president from 1977 to 1981.

The longest-lived former president has suffered from a series of health challenges in recent years, 
including surviving cancer, a broken hip and other recent hospitalizations for a 
fractured pelvis and a urinary tract infection.

He grew up in rural Georgia and served as governor of his state before beating 
incumbent Gerald Ford in the 1976 election.

And although the single-term Democratic president left the Oval office with 
poor approval ratings, he has spent the last several decades of his life committed to 
public service, including his work with the nonprofit Carter Center and Habitat for Humanity.
